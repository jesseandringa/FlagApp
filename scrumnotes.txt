Notes:

A lot of discussion on the design of the game. 
We've settled on a geography themed guessing game where the user 
is given a series of fun facts about a country, and the user has 
to guess what country is being described. With each wrong guess, 
a new, more obvious fact will be presented, and a blacked out 
image of the countries flag will be displayed, with more and 
more of the countries flag being revealed with each incorrect 
guess.
